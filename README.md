# About me
My name is Shah Jahan and I live in South Asia. I am comfortable with Java and I am participating in Google Code-in. I am aiming to become a Finalist and eventually the Grand Winner.
# How I learnt Java
I learnt Java through online video tutorials and lectures/courses on Udemy and Coursera. Also, I had a lot to learn from my elder siblings who were more comfortable with high-level programming.
